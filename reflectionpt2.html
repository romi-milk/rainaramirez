            <h2>My Reflection on the 2nd Quarter</h2>
            <p>
              During the second quarter of our TLE-ICT class, I experienced a lot of ups and downs. Simply because I have a hard time truly understanding the lessons. 
              However, when we were taking our tests and recitation about the lessons that were discussed, I suddenly remember everything that I have studied and what 
              was taught to us. It was really a miracle, or maybe I just don't have enough self-confidence when it comes to academics. Eitherway, I'm truly grateful to the people who 
              helped me during this quarter, and to Ms. Uminga too. I just think that I wasn't able to truly give my best during this quarter because of all the back-to-back
              activities, tests, and performance tasks that our teachers constantly give us. However, that didn't stop me from still trying hard to pass this class.
            </p>
            <p>
                The quarter wasn't without its struggles, but I pushed through, learning how to manage my time better and realizing the importance of teamwork and persistence. 
              It may have been difficult, but I know it'll all be worth it in the end. I look forward to applying these lessons in the next quarter.
