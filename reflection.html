<p align style="font-size:20px">This first quarter of TLE-ICT class, I've been through a rollercoaster of emotions. At first, I tell myself
that this lesson is easy and I'll ace it when we have a hands-on. However, I was wrong. Our ICT class is surely easy to understand but I had
a hard time with the quizzes and hands-on for certain lessons. I always forget about what syntax or attribute that I should use and the definition
or function of each item. Despite all that, I can say that I had a fun and memorable time this first quarter in our ICT class. I may fail all
of my hands-on or written works, but I can never lie by the fact that I actually enjoyed making websites and such.<br><br>

As first quarter comes to an end, I hope that I won't forget the things that I've learned during this quarter and apply it for our second quarter's
lessons and activities. I'm really looking forward for second quarter's lessons and activities.</p>
